Description: management suite for dotfiles
 You have dotfiles. Maybe you have them in a repo that you share; maybe you
 have them in a privately-backed up directory; or maybe you just have them
 scattered about your homedir. Regardless, this package provides a suite of
 programs that will help manage an existing dotfiles collection and also start
 a new one.
